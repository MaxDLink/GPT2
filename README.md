# Llama-Folder LLM Setup

This repository contains the setup for running an LLM using the `llama.cpp` implementation and the `Open Llama 3B` model. The project is organized using Git submodules to include external repositories.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Git**: Version control system
- **CMake**: Required to build `llama.cpp`
- **Python 3.x**: Needed for model conversion scripts
- **GCC**: GNU Compiler Collection (installed via Homebrew)
- **Hugging Face Account**: To download models from Hugging Face

## Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository along with its submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MaxDLink/GPT2.git
cd GPT2
```

This command will clone the main repository and all the submodules (i.e., `llama.cpp` and `Open Llama 3B`).

## Setting Up Submodules

If you forget to use the `--recurse-submodules` flag during cloning, you can initialize and update the submodules manually:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This command will pull in the necessary submodules.

## Converting Hugging Face Model

Before running the LLM, you need to convert the Hugging Face model to a format compatible with `llama.cpp`. If you haven't already, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `llama.cpp` directory:

    ```bash
    cd llama-folder/llama.cpp
    ```

2. Run the conversion script:

    ```bash
    python convert_hf_to_gguf.py --model ../open_llama_3b --outfile ./models/3B/
    ```

    This will convert the model and store it in the `./models/3B/` directory.

## Running the LLM

Once the model is converted, you can run the LLM using the following command:

1. Navigate to the `llama.cpp/build/bin` directory:

    ```bash
    cd build/bin
    ```

2. Run the LLM with a prompt:

    ```bash
    ./llama-cli -m ../../models/3B/Open_Llama_3B-3.4B-F16.gguf -p "What is the capital of France?"
    ```

    This command will execute the model and provide a response to the given prompt.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following tips:

- **Out of Memory**: If your machine runs out of memory, consider using a smaller model or running on a machine with more RAM.
- **Model Not Found**: Ensure the model file paths are correct and the conversion was successful.
- **Submodule Issues**: If the submodules are not initializing, try `git submodule update --init --recursive` again.
